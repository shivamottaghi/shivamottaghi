I am a computer engineer graduate, currently working on my web development skills at an awesome organization called ðŸ”¥[BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg)!


As I can remember, I always wanted to become a programmer, but IT world seemed vast and infinite in my eyes, there were a lot of fields
to be discovered. 
I loved Java when I studied it for one semester in university, I enjoyed working with relational DataBases too. Networking was 
a NO to me.
Then I got to know a bit of HTML and CSS, and I was like "Maybe that's it, maybe I wanna be a web developer!".
